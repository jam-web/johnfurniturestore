                <p>We are a small company but we provide service with the quality of a big brand name. Everything we sell is made from top notch quality material and we make sure that it is delivered to the customer on time. We offer a refund a policy where if you are not 100% satisfied with your purchase, you can return the product and get a full refund or exchange the product for another one, be it similar or not. You can return a product for up to 30 days from the date you purchased it. These are just some of the practices we have that separate us from other small businesses.</p>

        <p>This store was built in 1985 by a man named John Smith. It was based in Tampa, Florida. It was created with the intention of giving the residents of Tampa a good place to shop for furniture and housewares.  John is still here today.  While his original store is no longer around. Later he moved the store to online where he still runs the website and he still maintains the legacy. </p>
